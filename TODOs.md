Unsorted TODOs
--------------
* Links right now good looks overall, but is hard to read. 
* Cannot see too many feeds on a single screen. Provide user option to change height? More compact?
* Completely rewrite server stuff to make sure conforms to MVC and is optimized for efficiency
* Caching support - offline viewing
* Implement better date retrieval mechanism for server (if hrs and min not provided used retrieved time)
* Work on server. Store all feeds in own database, API that gets info from database and convert to json.
* JavaScript optimization is defered to the last step since I'm in the progress of going over advanced JavaScript. _(Second milestone)_
* Implement unit testing in milestone two.
* Use JSON for local storage in milestone two.
